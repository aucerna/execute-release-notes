We've been working closely with several of our clients as they roll out the new(ish) workflow capabilities of Execute 2020/21.  Through that process we've had some great suggestions on how to make the use experience more intuitive and user friendly.  This update includes many of those ideas.

In addition, we've been working hard to work through our list of your requests and this release addresses many of them including enhancements to the management of user permissions and rules, enhancements to session management, and some great new enhancements to formulas.
