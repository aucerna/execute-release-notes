feature,integration,"Introduced API Keys, a better and more secure way of authenticating to Execute when building integrations against the Execute APIs.  For those of you with existing API-based integrations, it is probably worthwhile migrating away from username/password and toward our API keys when possible. ",,api,165516
feature,system,"Execute now allows you to add additional custom tables to your documents to allow you to better lay out custom fields, as well as handle very large numbers of fields (more than 1000).  For those of you implementing many new workflows in RTx and watching your custom field count climb steadily upward, you can breath easier now. ",,table,175816
bug,system,Fixed an issue where an admin could create two columns whose names differed only by an underscore (i.e. AREA and AREA_) which would break OData reporting for those fields. ,,,224490
enhancement,installer,"We've updated the version of NSIS (the software that powers the Execute installer) and, while we were at it, we now display the version of Execute being installed in the installer to help avoid any ""oops, I installed the wrong version"" type mishaps. ",,,230486
bug,system,"We fixed an issue where specifying an invalid view within a custom sub-tab (plugin) would incorrectly break/hide all tabs.  We're all for making errors obvious so that they get corrected, but this was a little over the top. ",,,230872
enhancement,"links,user","The creator of a document link, and an administrator, are now able to update the comment on document links without removing and recreating the link.  Helpful for fixing up those embarrassing typos. ",,,231482
enhancement,"opsched,enersight","We added a new warning when exporting from OpSched to Enersight to highlight any step groups that are partially scheduled.  Enersight requires that all activities in a step group are either scheduled or unscheduled, and this helps catch those cases where that condition isn't met. ",,,231963
bug,afe,Fixed an issue where printing multiple forms on an AFE could fail intermittently. ,,,233247
bug,system,Fixed an issue where newly added rows in a grid (using non-default column grouping) would only appear after saving. ,,,233344
enhancement,well delivery,"If you were curious about who created that RTD/RTx/Job vs. who owns it now, we've added a new ""Creator"" column and backfilled it for all of your historical data using Execute's version history. ",,,233601
enhancement,integration agent,Improved the error message when the Integration Agent Data Replicator failed due to a column-type mismatch.  The error now shows the offending data types. ,,,233688
bug,afe,"For those of you dealing with monster print jobs (taking longer than 30 minutes to run), we've fixed the issue where, after waiting all that time, your download would fail. ",,,234123
enhancement,opsched,"Added a new schedule validation that highlights activities in a step group with inconsistent use of the ""Scheduled"" flag.  For activities in a step group, it is required/expected that they all be scheduled, or all be unscheduled. ",,,234126
bug,system,"Fixed an issue where Execute wouldn't reconnect/reload after a service outage (for example, after restarting the service).  Nothing a click of the Refresh button wouldn't solve, but this is nicer now. ",,,234148
bug,wellez,"Resolved an issue where linking an AFE to a WellEz job would sometimes fail with a validation error on  ""NumberValue"". ",,,234423
bug,"workflow,formula",Fixed an issue where calculated fields that referred to deleted workflow tasks could cause other calculated fields to inexplicably fail too.  ,,,234905
enhancement,workflow,"Added some nice navigation arrows to make it easier to open the related root document for a workflow task from the dashboard widgets, and the task completion popup. ",,nav,235278
schema,,Added new APIKEY* tables to store API Keys.,,,
