Schedule view configuration is able to control which activities are shown on an operational schedule, how they are colored, what information is shown, which resources are shown, milestones, etc. 

Unfortunately, the configuration for a Schedule View is complex.  In previous versions of Aucerna Execute, this configuration was difficult to modify.

This release includes a new graphical Schedule View Configuration tool.

* It is much easier to use and more discoverable (administrators will be able to use it to make adjustments to their views)
* It avoids syntax issues and typos that you encounter when editing view configuration by hand
* It provides drop-down lists of fields, colors, etc.

Here is a short demo of the new tool:
