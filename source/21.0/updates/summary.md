For many years, Aucerna Execute included major annual releases and small monthly/bi-monthly updates to the current major release.  These update releases provided an opportunity to deploy critical bug fixes and minor enhancements to the users of Aucerna Execute more quickly.

With Aucerna Execute 21 we are moving away from the major annual releases and will focus entirely on providing a stream of small incremental updates to the software (a process we've already been doing successfully for years). 

The primary reason for this move is to make it easier for everybody to stay current with new developments in Aucerna Execute:
* Ensures that users of Aucerna Execute have timely access to bug fixes and enhancements.
* For those of you with your own QA process, helps keep the testing burden manageable for each update (testing a few changes rather than a year or two of changes)
* Ensures that critical security fixes are deployed quickly

## FAQ

**How will I know when new updates are available?**

Pending updates will be visible to Aucerna Execute administrators in the dashboard, and in the Help > About screen.

**How many updates are we talking about?**

There is no specific release cadence we are targeting, although we would expect it to be similar to how updates are released today - roughly monthly.

**Do I have to take every update?**

No, although we do recommend staying current to ensure critical fixes are made in a timely fashion, and to ensure your users always have access to the latest and greatest.

If you choose to skip and update, however, don't worry.  Updating to the current release will always install any updates you missed along the way.

**What's involved in upgrading?**

For SaaS deployments of Aucerna Execute, get in touch with Client Services to schedule an update at a point where a brief outage is acceptable.  

For on-prem deployments of Aucerna Execute, simply installing the update over top of your existing deployment will update the software and automatically apply any database updates that are required.
