It's always important to keep software up-to-date and take advantage of any/all security fixes.

In this release, we have updated the versions of some of the 3rd party libraries that we use within Aucerna Execute.  This includes:

* jQuery
* jQuery UI
* Bootstrap
* MomentJS
* UnderscoreJS

In addition, we have migrated from our older charting library (HighCharts) to eCharts. 

**All of the above updates are behind the scenes and should have no impact on the end-users.**
