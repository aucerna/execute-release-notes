enhancement,budget,The project reforecasting process now always updates historical actuals to match those of the AFEs currently attached to the project.  This means that removing an AFE that was accidentally attached to the wrong project will automatically fix the historical project actuals during the next reforecast. ,,,164376
bug,opsched,"Fixed an issue where the background process that updated Jobs with the latest schedule information would create zillions of sessions rather than just creating one and reusing it.  Fortunately, these sessions were internal (no licensing effect), but it looked messy in the logs. ",,,241305
bug,system,"Updated the ""custom_table.config.sample"" to include an example of the GridHeight attribute which is used to control the size of the table.",,,241634
bug,system,Fixed issue where the Data Loaders were unable to load data into a table added to an Additional Storage Table. ,,,242480
bug,welldelivery,"Removed the configuration lock on the WELL and SITE fields on the RTX document so that administrators are able to update configuration for these fields (such as to adjust field-level permissions, and list field filters). ",,,243510
enhancement,afe,"Added a new AFE-level field ""Available Project Capital"" which shows the remaining capital available for an AFE (total capital available for allocation project activities less any AFEs allocated to those activities).  This makes it easy to build business rules that alert the user when their AFE exceeds the available budget.",,,243837
bug,system,Fixed an issue where formulas with many nested if() statements were extremely slow to compile/evaluate.   ,,,244145
enhancement,system,"Forced a ""recalculate"" when creating Excel Template Reports to resolve issues using those sheets directly in systems which don't support Excel calculations natively.   By the way, if you find it cumbersome to manage your Excel Template reports in Execute we'll have a thing for that in the next update!",,,244228
enhancement,"security,integration",Added an alert when adding a connection string to a SQL Server database without enabling end-to-end encryption in the connection string (Encrypt=true).  We strongly recommend enabling end-to-end encryption when configuring Execute to connect to any SQL / Azure SQL database over an untrusted network. ,,,244240
bug,opsched,"Job Scheduling supports automatically linking an activity to a single parent activity.  It is possible to configure the system such that an activity has multiple parents and, previously, doing so would cause the scheduling engine to fail.  This fix resolves that by skipping adding relationships for these invalid configurations. ",,,244317
enhancement,afe,"We made the account group on accounts an optional field so make implementation easier for those of you who don't need the cosmetic grouping of AFE costs by account group.  In addition, this makes it possible to sync the list of accounts from a 3rd party system that doesn't have a similar concept of Account Group. ",,,244439
bug,system,"Fixed an issue where a broken formula on a document would break the ""Undo"" button for that document. ",,,244529
enhancement,system,"Accidentally deleted the wrong document?  We've all done it.  We've now added a ""Undelete"" action to deleted records that restores that brings that document back from the dead.   In general, the rule of thumb is that ""if you can delete it, you can now undelete it!"".  (Note that for AFEs specifically, Undelete is only available for AFEs deleted after taking this update.)",,,244584
bug,system,Fixed an issue where a % sign included in a report title would prevent you from exporting that report to Excel. ,,,244942
bug,"afe,admin","Resolved issue where Account Rules could show ""UNDEFINED TEMPLATE 'contains'"" when using Account Rule by Pattern.",,,245202
bug,opsched,Resolved an issue where the schedule view configuration tool would fail to work properly on schedules without any activities. ,,,245393
enhancement,system,"If you are a heavy user of Document Links, you'll be overjoyed to know that you can now create summary tabs that list all linked documents of a specified type and give the administrator and the end-user the ability to control which columns they see.  These are controlled by the new ""plugins_available\customization\tabs\documentlinksummary.config.sample"" plugin",,,245826
feature,system,Improved support for integration with document management systems such as SharePoint and DynamicDocs. ,,doc,246071
schema,,"Added a new field ""IS_REMOVED_VERSION"" to the AFE and AFE_H tables to differentiate between deleted AFEs and deleted AFE versions (unrevise/unsupplement) to support the new Undelete feature.",,,
enhancement,afe,Sample configuration for integration with Quorum's OnDemand Accounting system,,,
