The release resolves several issues, including fixing limitations on the character length for Help Text and custom tab text fields, ensuring new-style grids configured via a plugin adhere to configured sort columns, and resolving a critical bug in the integration to on-prem WellView/SiteView where API calls to retrieve wells and jobs were failing.
