feature,integration,Added support for integration with our very own Val Nav from Quorum-hosted Execute environments using the Integration Agent. ,,,161179
bug,"system,usability",Improvements to numeric entry in the new Excel-style grids that made it difficult to edit values with thousand separators (commas) in them.  ,,,164731
enhancement,security,Technical upgrade to document copy pop-screen to remove an out-of-date component. ,,,166570
enhancement,"system,admin","Custom Business Rules now have an ACTIVE flag, which allows you to easily turn off rules you don't need any longer. ",,,171791
bug,"system,usability","We've resolved an issue in the formula editor where it would gobble up more and more of your browser's memory until, eventually, the browser would decide to kill of the process (losing your formula changes).  This issue only reared it's ugly head when editing super complex formulas but, as it turns out, many of you are doing just that! ",,,175408
feature,"system,usability","If you've ever found yourself annoyed by date fields that insist on capturing not only the date, but also the time.  If your organization is spread across timezones and you've struggled with date fields where the day changes depending on where you are viewing Execute...  We have good news.  We have added support for creating date-only fields which are never affected by your user's timezone!   ",,dates,175938
enhancement,security,Upgraded multiple 3rd party components to resolve a potential security issue. ,,,176492
bug,"system,usability",Fixed issue where you couldn't clear an integer value from a new-style data grid.    ,,,179563
enhancement,system,Improved the help / error text for default values to make it more obvious how to set default values for decimal fields. ,,,179772
bug,system,Fixed issue with Attachment fields in new-style data grids causing weird navigation behaviour. ,,,180037
bug,"afe,usability",Restored the handy behaviour where the email icon next to a review in the Reviewers tab would automatically partially fill out the email body.  This functionality was accidentally missed when the tab was reworked as part of a larger technical update. ,,,180049
bug,system,"Fixed issue upgrading Postgres based Execute database (currently, only used by internal demo environments). ",,,180357
bug,welldelivery,Fixed issue where the table on the Jobs tab (Wells and Sites) would break if it included in-active fields. ,,,180370
enhancement,system,"The detailed change history on a document is great, but defaulting to loading detailed history for all time is excessive and can adversely impact the performance of the system.  We've updated the Change Tracking tab to load only 60 days of detailed history by default.  If there is more history than that to show, you'll see a ""Load All History"" button which will bring in the rest of it. ",,history,180622
enhancement,workflow,Curious how long it takes a workflow task to complete?  We've now now added a TaskAssignedDate function to calculated fields (to sit alongside the TaskCompleteDate function) so that you can now calculate just how long some of those critical tasks take to complete. ,,,180668
bug,workflow,We fixed up an issue where the assigned tasks reminder would potentially include the summary table once per task assigned to the owner.  ,,,180744
enhancement,system,"If you have multiple Document Synchronizations configured against the same type of Document, we now append the sync component's ID to the log filename so that you can tell them apart. ",,,180847
enhancement,"afe,peloton",Adjusted the export of estimates sent to WellView/SiteView so that they are sorted by account number. ,,,180876
feature,system,"The Execute ""plugins_available"" folder is a collection of sample configuration files used to adjust the behaviour of Execute (most commonly, integrations).  We've done a bunch of clean-up in this folder to make it easier to find a relevant sample, and we've added piles of documentation to those sample files to make configuration much easier.  Our focus on this release was Data Synchronization and Data Selection, but we'll continue to work on this in the coming releases.  If you think that deploying these files is too difficult (needing to have IT or Quorum Application Delivery actually deploy the plugin) we have a new feature coming very soon that is going to make this process approximately 100% easier! ",,,181647
feature,system,"We have made SUBSTANTIAL improvements to Null (no value) handling in Execute's calculated fields. Nowhere is this more apparent, and needed, than our handling of date fields where, previously, an empty date field would read as January 1, 0001.  Along with these changes, the IsNull function now can be used to detect an empty field so that you can build formula logic around that. Never has nothing been so exciting!",,null,172933
feature,system,We've added a new setting to Document Synchronizations that can automatically inactivate records in Execute that are no longer found in the source data.  ,,sync,181530
