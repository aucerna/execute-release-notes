This update of Execute changes the version of the .NET Framework Execute uses from .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 6.0.  

This should have no user-facing effect on Execute and, because Execute is compiled as a standalone application which includes the appropriate version of the .NET Framework, there is no need to make any changes to the packages deployed on the application server hosting Execute.
