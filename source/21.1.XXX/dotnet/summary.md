This update of Execute changes the version of the .NET Framework Execute uses from 3.5 to 6.0.  

This should have no user-facing effect on Execute and, because Execute is compiled as a standalone application which *includes the appropriate version of the .NET Framework, there is no need to make any cahnges to the application server hosting Execute.
