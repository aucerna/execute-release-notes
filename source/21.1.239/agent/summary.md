Plugins that connect to a database via the integration agent **MUST** be updated to work in the new version.  This work will need to be undertaken by Quorum Support/Application Delivery when upgrading your SaaS environment.  We'll be sure to do that as part of your upgrade.

Other plugins that contain connection strings will continue to work but should eventually be updated to take advantage of the new connection string editor.
