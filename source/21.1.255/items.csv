enhancement,"admin,links","If you are a heavy user of document links, you can now create extended document links (see extended_document_link.config.sample).  This allows you to show links for documents linked to other linked documents.  And because that sentence left more questions than it answered, here is an example:  A common setup is for a Pad Site to be linked to one or more Wells.  A Well is linked to one or more Jobs.  A Job is linked to an AFE.  This feature allows you to say, ""I'd like to see those AFEs that are linked to Jobs that are linked to the Wells on this pad as virtual document links on my Pad Site so that I can, amoung other things, make use of Execute's formulas to give me a total AFE cost across all the Jobs on all the Wells on my Pad.""",,,257218
