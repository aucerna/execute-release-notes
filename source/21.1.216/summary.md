This update contains loads of exciting new features and fixes, but a few of our favourites are:

1. Support for resetting workflow tasks and restarting parts of a workflow
2. Improvements to the integration with OnDemand Well Operations (WellEz) for multi-job AFEs
3. Credentials for 3rd party systems are now stored in our equivalent of Fort Knox
4. Aucerna Execute is now "Quorum Execute" or "Execute" for short
