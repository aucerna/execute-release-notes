enhancement,"integration,valnav",We've made some improvements to the error messages returned by our Integration Agent so that troubleshooting is a whole lot easier when things don't go according to plan. ,,,265027
enhancement,"performance,opsched","We've significantly improved the import speed for new activities on a busy schedule. In our test of importing 7,300 rows, we reduced the import time from 4.5 minutes to a brisk 7 seconds (a time savings of one metric coffee break!).   ",,,268392
enhancement,integration agent,A bit of spring cleaning on the Integration Agent to ensure things keep running smoothly. ,,,268543
bug,integration agent,Resolved an issue where the Integration Agent's table replicator couldn't handle null boolean values on SQL Server. ,,,268904
enhancement,"performance,ui,opsched","To keep Execute's Job Scheduling feeling snappy, we've limited the number of rows shown in the Job Hopper to 1000.   Users will see a warning if they are seeing a partial result set, and searching will still search all rows and just return the (maximum 1000) matching rows. ",,,269387
enhancement,"performance,ui,opsched",We've reduced the volume of schedule data we read from the Execute server on each schedule change.  This will substantially improve the performance of operational scheduling for large schedules and users with high-latency Internet connections. ,,,269388
enhancement,"performance,ui","We've seriously reduced the amount of data loaded, and the number of API calls made when loading a tab in Execute.  This has the effect of substantially improving tab loading/switching performance, especially for very large (many custom fields) documents and users with high-latency Internet links. ",,,274567
enhancement,"performance,system,admin","Execute' Support Package Generator is great for sending a copy of your environment's configuration to Quorum for help.  Unfortunately, generating the support package was quite slow for certain configurations.  We've made some improvements to the speed and memory usage for these configurations. ",,,275762
enhancement,"performance,integration","Execute's Data Warehouse feature ensures Execute data is efficiently replicated in an external AzureSQL or Snowflake.  Sometimes, however, if you made a pile of changes in Execute, syncing those changes into the warehouse could take a bit of time.  If you tried restarting Execute while that was happening, it would apparently hang without any obvious indication of why.  We've added some logging to make it easier to see what's going on.  ",,,275780
enhancement,"performance,integration","Document Synchronization and Bulk Loads could perform poorly when dealing with very large numbers of records with a unique validation rule (such as PARTNERS, ACCOUNTS, ...). In one environment with ~150k partners, the system would take many seconds to process each partner. With this enhancement, that same environment is loading records at a blazing 300 pps (partners per second).",,,279727
bug,"performance,opsched",We've eliminated a potential memory leak in Operational Scheduling where the detail grids (below the gantt) weren't always cleaned up properly when we didn't need them any more. ,,,279943
enhancement,performance,We've made some improvements to responsiveness when pasting large amounts of data from Excel (using our import/update multiple record functionality). ,,,280994&280995
enhancement,plugins,We've continued to clean-up and finesse our Data Selector sample configuration files to make them easier to understand and implement. ,,,281351
