Since Quorum Execute has joined the Quorum family, we thought it was a great time to refresh our look a bit.  

Quorum Execute 21 now features a Quorum inspired color schema.

We love the new look and hope you do too.

If, however, you long for the old color schema you are can select it under your user settings screen.
