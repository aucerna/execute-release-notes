The Quorum Execute Integration Agent is a new service which can be installed on an on-prem server to facilitate integrations between cloud-based deployments of Quorum Execute and on-prem systems.  The integration agent is not required for instances of Quorum Execute installed on client-managed infrastructure.

The Integration Agent makes it easier/possible for existing clients to migrate from their on-prem installation of Quorum Execute, to a Quorum-hosted instance, if desired.

More information on the Integration Agent can [be found here](https://documentation.aucerna.app/execute/Topics/Integration/IntegrationAgent/IntegrationAgent.htm).
