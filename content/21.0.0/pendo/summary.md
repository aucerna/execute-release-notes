In order to help us make better decisions about future product development, this release incorporates high-level usage telemetry using the industry standard 3rd party service [Pendo](https://pendo.io).

**What information is collected?**

Under no circumstances is any specific business data (such as AFEs, Jobs, Wells, etc.) collected or transmitted back to Quorum or Pendo.  Keyboard activity is never sent to Pendo.

The information we do record is:

* Company Name (Licensed Company)
* User Name
* User Email Address
* Events from user interactions with Quorum Execute (page loads, button clicks, etc.)
* Browser information (remote IP address, User Agent)
* User provided feedback (bug reports / feature requests) (note: this functionality hasn't been enabled yet)

**What will this information be used for?**

This information is captured to provide the Quorum Products team critical information to help guide product development.

For example:
* Identify high-usage areas of the software to help prioritize usability improvements.
* Identify unused areas of the software which are no longer needed.
* Sometimes the workflow we think our users will adopt in our software doesn't match what works best for them.  This data will help us identify these situations and better streamline our workflows for you.

This information will not be used for sales or marketing purposes.

**What if I'm uncomfortable with this data collection?**
