Quorum Execute 2019 introduced first-class integration with Peloton's WellView and SiteView.  This integration allows:

1. AFE Owners can see up-to-date spending against their AFEs (Peloton's Field Costs)
2. Field staff can see up-to-date AFE status and budget in WellView/SiteView

This release reintroduces that functionality for Peloton's hosted (SaaS) WellView product.

More information on the integration with WellView and SiteView can be found in [the Quorum Execute online documentation](https://documentation.aucerna.app/execute/Topics/Integration/WellViewSiteView/WellViewSiteView.htm).

<p class="alert alert-warning"><b>Note:</b> At this time, SiteView support is still being worked on and not available.</p>
