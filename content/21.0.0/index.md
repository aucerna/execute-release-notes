Quorum Execute 21.0 follows the Quorum Execute 2020 release with a focus on cloud functionality, improved integrations, and usability improvements.

Many of you have cloud initiatives under-way, and we've heard from many of you that you would like to simplify your IT footprint by moving many of your systems into the cloud.   A common stumbling block was maintaining the level of integrations with on-prem systems (accounting, well data, etc.) that on-prem deployments of Quorum Execute currently enjoy.

* This release of Quorum Execute includes new functionality to allow cloud-based Quorum Execute to integrate with those on-prem systems you currently have.  
* In addition, we've added support for [Okta](https://okta.com) to enable that seamless single-signon experience that everybody loves in their on-prem environments.  

If you choose to keep your Quorum Execute instance running on your infrastructure, it will keep running as before.  If, however, your team has been looking to migrate Quorum Execute into a Quorum hosted environment, the new Quorum Execute 21 will make that more seamless.

We've also heard from many of you how important integration with your operational well data tools (such as WellView or WellEz) can be.  This release adds seamless integration with our very own WellEz, as well as adds support for cloud-based installations of Peloton's WellView.
