This release follows close on the heals of the previous update with another wave of great enhancements (thank you for the great ideas!), and several crushed bugs.

Some highlights in this update are:

* Great new enhancements around Document Links functionality.
* Automatically generated Well and Site numbers!
* New columns on Capital Budgeting reports to make data verification/QC easier.
* The ability to copy Projects and Workflows!
