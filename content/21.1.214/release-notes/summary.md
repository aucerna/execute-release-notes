With Execute's move to smaller and more frequent releases, keeping tabs on What's New could be a bit overwhelming.  In this release, we've changed things a bit.

When new versions of Execute are available, administrators with the "IT Monitor" administrator privilege will continue to see a dashboard widget notifying them of the availability of a new version.  This panel now includes a "What's New" link which shows a summarized list of all new changes (potentially summarizing multiple releases) released since the version currently running in that environment.  If you are a few versions behind on your upgrades, this gives one place to look for all of the new bug fixes and exciting enhancements you'll receive when you upgrade your environment.  

Similarly, the "About" screen will also show information about the next available version and a link to the same summarized release notes.

Similarly, under the help menu, release notes have also been split into two options:

1. "Release Notes (Available Version)" is a link to the summarized release notes showing everything new and exciting when you upgrade your environment
2. "Release Notes (Current Version)" is a link to the release notes for the version of Execute currently running in the environment
