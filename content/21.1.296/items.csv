enhancement,system,"If you'd like to see your primary document types (those in the top toolbar) in a specific order and have been annoyed at how prefixing them with ""1."", ""2."", ... made everything else in the application look a bit wonky... good news.  We've added a new configuration setting that allows you to set the sort order! ",,,338259
enhancement,integration,We've lowered the batch size limit when exporting Execute data to Snowflake / Azure SQL to help eliminate issues with large documents like Schedules causing excessively large batches. ,,,337950
enhancement,"integration,wellez","We've relaxed the rules a bit for account matching between Execute and ODW.  So if your Execute account numbers are formatted like ""100 / 234"", but you have ""100 .-=-. 234"" in ODW, you'll be pleased to know that the integration will work just fine. ",,,337090

enhancement,formula,"We've improved the Min/Max formula functions to work with date-type fields, and to have more sensible handling of null (empty) values.  Note that with the new changes ""Min(1,null,2)"" will now return ""1"" whereas it used to treat the null as a zero and would have returned ""0"".  If you need this old behaviour, you can wrap the values with the coalesce function ""Min(1, coalesce(null,0), 2)"".",,,338039
