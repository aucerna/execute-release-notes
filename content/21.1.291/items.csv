bug,workflow,Resolved a terrible issue where removing a task from a workflow definition could cause all other task dependencies in that workflow definition to be cleared out (requiring you to manually add them back to each task). ,,,250285
enhancement,integration,"Execute has a great integration with Quorum's On Demand Well Operations (ODW) software, ensuring alignment between field staff and head office.  Unfortunately, we were a tad retro and still referred to it as WellEz, which hasn't been its name for a couple of years.  We've updated the occurrences of WellEz within AFE Navig... err... Execute to reflect our new product naming. ",,,258545
bug,workflow,"Resolved an issue where deleting a task and rolling out the updated workflow definition would raise mysterious ""The given key..."" warnings for any instances where that task had already been completed. ",,,264449
enhancement,system,"We have continued upgrading the various column selection screens throughout the application (workflow definition tasks, field cost entry and AFE wells) to make them more consistent and eliminate a legacy component. ",,,317218
bug,reporting,"Cleaned up a minor issue with our new column selectors where it was showing the underlying document type ""RTX"" instead of a nice use-facing ""Job"" in the breadcrumbs. ",,,328492
enhancement,system,Execute will now ensure that we don't exceed database-level maximum row-size constraints when adding columns to custom tables. ,,,330990
enhancement,reporting,"While the ASCII arrow (=>) in our new column selection screens would appeal to the computing hipsters in the crowd, we figured we should replace it with a proper icon instead. ",,,332237
enhancement,reporting,"We've added two new fields to Execute to make building/maintaining your printed forms a bit easier (for us, if we're being honest).  Partners now have a ""logo"" field, and users now have a ""signature"" field, which can be used instead of baking your various logos and signatures directly into the forms themselves.  This makes things a bit easier to maintain over the long haul. ",,,332291
enhancement,system,Additional configuration flags are now included in the startup logs to assist with troubleshooting and support. ,,,332294
bug,workflow,"We've fixed a frustrating issue with the workflow task editor that caused changes to the graphical rules (completion rule, activation rule, etc.) to be lost when switching tabs. ",,,332743
bug,system,"To our users who prefer to see their dates in the format ""dd/mm/yyyy"", we are deeply sorry.  For YEARS, it seems, we've had an issue in our date entry controls where a user whose preferred date format was set to ""dd/mm/yyyy"" would see the month and day flip-flop each time they clicked into a date control (for dates where the day was also a valid month).   ",,,332951
bug,system,"Adding insult to injury for those who prefer the ""dd/mm/yyyy"" date format, we discovered that format would break the ""Workflow"" tab.  This has been resolved. ",,,333059
enhancement,workflow,We've improved the scrollbars when viewing the diagram on really wide workflow definitions. ,,,333081
bug,system,"Resolved an issue where changes made to a Blockly rule after using the ""Code Editor"" mode were not saved properly. ",,,333156
bug,system,"Fixed an issue where Audit events (such as an admin force approving an AFE) were not showing on the Change Tracking tab as intended.  Note that the changes made were always captured in the change history, and the audit event itself was still captured and visible in the global audit log. ",,,333327
schema,,Added PARTNER.LOGO_BASE64 and USER.SIGNATURE_BASE64 fields to store images for forms use.,,,
