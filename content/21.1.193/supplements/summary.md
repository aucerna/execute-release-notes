A common request has been to extend the "AFE - Line-item" and "AFE - Line-item by Date" report types to include some of the additional "approved" and "supplemental" estimate columns found on the base AFE report type.

As such, we've extended both report types to include the following additional columns:

* Line-item Detail - Supplemental Gross Estimate
* Line-item Detail - Supplemental Net Estimate
* Line-item Detail - Approved Gross Estimate
* Line-item Detail - Approved Net Estimate
* Line-item Detail - Net Estimate
