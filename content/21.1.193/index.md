This update resolves a critical error introduced in 21.1.184 where the AFE's operator would be incorrectly overwritten by the parent company.  It also includes some nice new columns for reporting on detailed supplemental estimates.

**Note:  This updated requires Integration Agent 1.0.47 or higher.**
