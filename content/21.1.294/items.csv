bug,system,"Resolved an issue where foreign keys on Postgres-based Execute databases were missing ""on delete cascade"". ",,,299474
bug,system,Resolved an issue where fields in a Blockly loop variable would fail to show the nice field name. ,,,326878
bug,system,"Restored the helpful ""User Has Permission"" and ""User In Group"" features that allowed you to build custom business rules based on the user's permissions. ",,,332811
bug,AFE,Resolved an issue where users were unable to add new attachments using our legacy Linked Files behaviour. ,,,334654
feature,AFE,"Introduced new Approval/System Review paths, which provide another great option for creating and managing your business rules. Approval/Review paths are intended to be very simple to build and understand.  As a bonus, they also better support integration with 3rd party systems which don't share Execute's concept of Approving Position. ",,path,334867
feature,AFE,"We've added a new setting, ""Allow User Delegation"", which allows users to delegate their AFE/Job review and approval duties. We've left this functionality off by default because we know that it doesn't make sense for some organizations who want strict control over who a user selects to approve/review on their behalf. For environments that need this, however, it's a quick flip of a setting and users will find the new option under their user menu in the top-right of their screen. ",,user,334871
bug,system,Resolved an issue where referencing DOCUMENT_ID in custom business rules could cause the rule to break. ,,,334940
feature,system,"Execute has great little ""+"" icons next to list fields which are a quick shortcut allowing an authorized user to create a new value for that list and automatically select it. Just the thing when you go to create a new AFE, but realize nobody got around to adding that newly acquired asset to the list in Execute. This release improves upon this functionality by defaulting to the new record type's first tab (rather than our currently non-user-friendly approach of generating a tab using the alphabetical list of all fields on the record.). In addition, administrators can create a special ""Quick Add"" tab to streamline the experience. ",,quick,335025
bug,dashboard,Resolved an issue where frozen column headers were inadvertently showing up on the Execute dashboard (and looking rather broken while doing it). ,,,335045
enhancement,"peloton,integration",Support for importing recurring/rental costs from WellView. Currently this behaviour is off by default but it can be opted in if you rely on these costs. We will be enabling this by default in a future release. ,,,335145
bug,attachments,Resolved an issue where creating a specially named attachment and then deleting it would break attachments for that parent record (all attachments mysteriously disappear). We won't mention the specific naming here because the temptation to try it is probably too great :) ,,,335282
enhancement,attachments,"We've turned off the old (and we're talking really old) linked files to attachments migration. This feature was slowing down startup in some environments and at this point we think everybody who would switch over has. If it's needed, it's a mere setting tweak away. ",,,335525
bug,workflow,"Resolved an issue where Blockly rules on a workflow task would sometimes ""jump tabs"" when making edits and switching back and forth between completion rules, assigned to rules, etc. ",,,335624
enhancement,"integration,wellez","It took us a couple of years to roll out the rename of WellEz to On Demand Well Operations within Execute, but we finally did it. Hilariously, however, we did so two weeks before we decided to stick with WellEz after all. This updates brings back the much loved WellEz name. ",,,335780
