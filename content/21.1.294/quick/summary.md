# Improved Quick Add Experience

In Execute, list fields typically include a `+` icon that lets users quickly create and select a new record of that type.

Historically, the Quick Add pop-up form wasn’t exactly elegant—it displayed all fields on the new record in alphabetical order, which wasn’t always helpful.

In this release, Quick Add now defaults to using the first (default) tab defined for that document type. It will only fall back to the alphabetical view if no custom tabs are available.

So now, adding a Pad from your Well looks a whole lot cleaner:

And if I'd like further control, you can create a special "Quick Add" custom tab and really dial it in!
