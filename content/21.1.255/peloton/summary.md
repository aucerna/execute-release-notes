This release includes support for Peloton's new 2.0 APIs (affecting Peloton SaaS customers).

Peloton has announced their plans to deprecate their existing APIs (used by previous versions of Execute's integration with Peloton SaaS) by the end of February.

Customers who wish to use/continue to use this integration must:

1. Contact Peloton support and request written permission to enable this integration (cc'ing Execute Support).  Peloton requires customers obtain written permission prior to integrating with third parties.
2. Upgrade Execute to this version or later.
3. Work with Execute Support to update their configuration to use the new integration.
